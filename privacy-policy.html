    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 06 December 2025</p>
    <hr />

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Kids Learning</strong> mobile application
        (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you or your child
        uses our app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Kids Learning</strong> is designed for children and aims to collect
        minimal information. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, or precise locations.
    </p>

    <h3>a) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>
        When you use the app, certain non-personal information may be collected automatically,
        such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and model</li>
        <li>Operating system version</li>
        <li>App version and usage data</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is used only to improve the app’s performance and user experience.
        It does not directly identify you or your child.
    </p>

    <h3>b) Information Collected Through Third-Party Services (e.g., AdMob)</h3>
    <p>
        If the app displays ads using third-party services such as
        <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, these services may collect certain information,
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous identifiers related to your device</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
        <li>General usage information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For child-directed apps, ads are typically shown as <strong>non-personalized</strong>
        to comply with children’s privacy regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is intended for use by children under the supervision of parents or guardians.
        We are committed to protecting children’s privacy and complying with applicable laws
        and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request or collect personally identifiable information from children</li>
        <li>Require account creation or login</li>
        <li>Collect precise location data</li>
        <li>Sell or share personal information with third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you believe that your child may have provided personal information through the app,
        please contact us using the details below, and we will promptly delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        Any information collected (typically non-personal and aggregated) is used for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improving app stability and performance</li>
        <li>Fixing bugs and technical issues</li>
        <li>Enhancing features and user experience</li>
        <li>Displaying appropriate and child-safe advertisements (if enabled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use this information to personally identify users.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our app may include third-party services such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for showing ads</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics services</strong> – for understanding app usage (if integrated)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These third-party services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review
        them:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Google AdMob &amp; Google Mobile Ads Policies:
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://policies.google.com/privacy
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect any information processed by the app from
        unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of
        electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot
        guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We do not store personal data on our own servers. Any non-personal data collected
        through third-party services is retained in accordance with their respective policies.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
        “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We recommend that you review this page
        periodically for any changes.
    </p>
